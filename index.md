# Welcome. Bienvenidos. Bienvenue. 歡迎光臨。

I am a Frontend Software Developer. I code at [YoppWorks](https://www.yoppworks.com), developing web and mobile apps with React, React Native, JavaScript ES6 and related technologies such as Redux, Redux Saga and lodash/fp. I love functional programming. I am currently learning Reactive Architecture and Scala programming and Spark.

## The Future Awaits
I am an aspiring Data Scientist. What exactly this means to me is still to be defined but my journey has begun and this site will help chronicle this journey. It begins at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca) as an unclassified (non-degree seeking "5th year" undergrad) student where I am currently getting up to speed with Mathematics.

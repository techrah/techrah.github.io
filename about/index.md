I am a professional software developer currently serving up web and mobile apps with React, React Native, JavaScript (ES2015+) and related technologies such as Redux, Redux Saga and lodash/fp. I am a functional programming enthusiast and love applying FP paradigms in JavaScript.

I have been creating mobile apps since 2009 and React apps since 2016 and have worked with many companies to help them to bring their apps to market.

I am a Frontend Software Developer. I code at [YoppWorks](https://www.yoppworks.com), developing web and mobile apps with React, React Native, JavaScript ES6 and related technologies such as Redux, Redux Saga and lodash/fp. I love functional programming. I am currently learning Reactive Architecture, Scala programming and Spark.

I made my debut in mobile app development in 2008 with the iPhone and have since worked with many Canadian companies, helping them to bring their apps to market.
